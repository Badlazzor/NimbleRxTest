This tiny helper library helps connecting one of the most popular testing library for swift (Quick) with the reactive world. First when I had to write tests for a reactive project I was struggling with RxBlocking or event unwrapping usually using .debug() to help understanding what is exactly happening in a reactive chain. After a while I thought "Oh, come on! I have this lovely Nimble thingy and I know XCAssert helper things was created for RxTest, why not do the same in Nimble?". Before I realised I used the same code to help me with binding Nimble and Rx together in 3 or 4 projects copying the same files in every one of them.

And so the NimbleRxTest lib was born.
